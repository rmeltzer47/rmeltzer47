  <p>My mom had expressed dissatisfaction with our coffee table, as it was beginning to get older and worn down by daily usage and having 4 kids (2 very young). I was taking a woodshop class for the 4th time and I suggested that maybe I could make one to replace it. 
  I was able to utilize skills with both power tools and hand tools. I utilized techniques including, but not limited to: routing inlays, mortise and tenons, joinery, and dadoing. 
  I faced a major challenge during the creation of the table. After completing the top before attaching it to the base the climate control system stopped working. Due to the heat and humidity of the season the top warped to the point that it no longer sat flat. 
  I alleviated the problem by connecting the table with dowels and clamps to connect and reform the top to the base. 
  The result of this project is the coffee table seen above, which now resides in my own bedroom in my parentâ€™s house, as we moved and it is too small for the new den.</p>
  <h1>Project 2 - Northeastern University Marino Fitness Center Weight Room Redesign</h1>

  <p>Details</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Created: Sophomore year of university (2015-2016)</li>
    <li>Team Members: Michael Janov, Nikolas Argentinis, James Garbier</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Details</p>
  <p>During our Introduction to Industrial Engineering class we were tasked with improving something based on skills we had learned in class
  Our team noticed that there was no real system to how the weights were set up at the gym, costing time and effort when trying to lift weights. We sought to complete an entire redesign of the weight room layout to reduce time wasted moving from machine to machine during a workout. We began by cataloguing and categorizing the weight machines offered on both the second and third floors (extra diagrams included in final PDF of report, linlked below) by targeted major muscle group. 
  We began by doing time and motion studies to find the largest areas where traffic congestion caused a slowdown in machine usage and added time to the overall workout unnecessarily. We then utilized a cellular manufacturing technique to determine which machines would be categorized into each group of machines, as many of the machines target muscles in different groups at the same time. One we completed that we tried to lay out the gym to match machine groups together to reduce travel time between machines. 
  For example, the back/bicep, leg, and chest/tricep machines were placed in close proximity but distinctly separated to allow people to cut down on travel time whether they were doing a targeted workout or a total body workout. We also moved the multigym machines and free weights to a separate area entirely to allow those who use free weights and those who use machine weights to avoid causing issues with each other. 
  The results of this project are minimal as we completed it for a class, however we hypothesized that foot traffic amongst the machines would be reduced enhancing the overall lifting experience at Marino.</p>
